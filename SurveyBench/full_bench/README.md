We offer **SurveyBench**, a benchmark for **academic research** and **evaluating the quality of AI-generated surveys.**

Currently , SurveyBench consists of approximately 100 human-written survey papers across 10 distinct topics, carefully curated by doctoral-level researchers to ensure thematic consistency and academic rigor. The supported topics and the core references corresponding to each topic are as follows:
